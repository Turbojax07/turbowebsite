TODO list!

In General
- Figure out how to remove the scroll bar.  It doesn't need to be everywhere.

CNU Classes
- Make the list more searchable. (add more options)
- Figure out a better way of getting the data than collecting it all when the website loads.
  - Something like a postgres database may help with this.
- Make filters persist on refresh.
- Rather than requiring users to refresh the page to update data, maybe try having the data update on a set interval, or add a button for it.
  - This would mean moving the functionality of the jinja template to a javascript program

CTFS
- Make a better homepage for the ctf

Resume
- Make it ATS-compliant or whatever

Main Page:
- Remove some of the photos and maybe add actual information to it.
