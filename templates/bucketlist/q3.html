        A while back, I upgraded my computer and added a water cooler to it.  The problem with the new cooler was that it got in the way of the ports on the front of the computer, so I had to take them out.  For a while, I just had multiple ports hanging out from the back of my computer, so I decided to do something about it.  I designed a brick that I could mount the ports to and then insert into a slot that I wasn't using on my computer.  Now, I don't have a 3d printer of my own, but a friend of mine was very helpful and offered to print the brick for me.  Unfortunately, the brick printed backwards, so I now need to redesign it to actually work.

        I'm not big into birthday parties anymore, but I figured it'd be good for me to do something for this bucket list, so here we are!  I went to Bowl America, and made my best attempt at bowling.  I'm not very good with many sports, and bowling is no different.  I did not come close to winning any of the three games we played, but it was fun to hang out with my family!  I got a grand total of 2 spares and 31 gutter balls, and my highest score was a 58.

        Radford University is a college in Virginia that hosts a CTF (Capture The Flag).  CTFs are a set of computer challenges like decrypting messages or securing operating systems.  The more you solve, the more points you get.  Radford is a great introductory CTF as it has a wide variety of challenges that can get you introduced to what a CTF is and some of the things you may do in one.  Our team was Enron Accounting, and we ended up placing 3rd overall.  Despite out success, we noticed a few issues.  Many of the challenges this year had spelling issues, and some of the challenges that were meant to be done in order were scrambled, causing issues if the answer from one challenge was based on the challenenge before it.  The answers were also weirdly specific.  One of the answers to a challenge was "J. K. Simmons", the name of the man who player J. Jonah Jameson.  The problem was that that was the ONLY accepted answer.  It did not work with "J K Simmons", "Jonathan Simmons", or "Jonathan Kimble Simmons".  Issues like these were scattered around the CTF, and it made me wonder; who makes the challenges?

        Two months ago, the game for the FIRST FRC challenge was announced.  Two months ago we began designing and building our robot.  This weekend, it was time for it to shine!  This is the week 1 competition for the Chesapeake District, and we did pretty well!  There were a few mechanical issues with how high the elevator could go, and our autonomous mode didn't work very well, but we did alright.  We ended up placing 19th out of 39, but we were already preparing for next week.

        This week we had a bit more experience driving the robot and playing the game.  We had also updated the code to get a working autonomous program.  The venue was in Portsmouth, and it was quite large!  The field and pit areas were all in one room.  We ended up placing 6th overall, and we made it to the final match.  Unfortunately, we lost, but we did break 100 points in both matches!  The only problem we had during the competition was with the wifi.  There wasn't any public wifi in the school, and cellular data was being blocked by the school.  This made it difficult to contact people, and was also troublesome when debugging code.
