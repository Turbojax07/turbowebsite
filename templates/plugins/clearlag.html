# ClearLag

This plugin allows servers to automatically remove entities every 10 minutes.  This loop time can be changed.
You can also configure all of the logged messages, specify entities that won't be removed by the plugin, and configure a few more flags about what might make an entity exempt from being removed.

PlaceholderAPI is required by this plugin.
