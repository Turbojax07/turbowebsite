# PluginPlayground

# THIS IS NOT AN ACTUAL PLUGIN AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED FOR DEMONSTRATIONS!  IT IS NOT BUILT TO COMPILE!

## This plugin is created by me so that new developers can see examples of how to do different things when making plugins.  This includes but is not limited to, bukkit commands, the brigadier command api, yaml file configurations, file management, SQL drivers, event listeners, and more.
## Note that this is in very early development and we don't have much stuff made right now.
