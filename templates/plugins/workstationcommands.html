# WorkstationCommands
This is my first published minecraft plugin!  
It adds commands for each workstation in minecraft.  
These commands provide as much configuration as I can reasonably give.  You can enable/disable commands, add/remove aliases, and manage specific permissions.

[![modrinth](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy/available/modrinth_vector.svg)](https://modrinth.com/plugin/workstationcommands)
