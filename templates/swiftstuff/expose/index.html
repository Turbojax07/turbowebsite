  <a href="https://discord.gg/AA82qX6bvg">Click here to join my new server</a>. I've been trying to get Swift to share this website, but they didn't, meaning not everyone knows the truth. So I'm just gonna move on from them. Please only join this if you want to. Please also read this document first, as I want you to decide fairly.

  <p>The views, allegations and opinions expressed here are my own, based on evidence I have gathered. Do not harass any party involved in this document. All suspects are innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.</p>
  <h2 style="color: darkgreen;">The latest in the drama</h2>
  <p>Kat said I raided the server when I did not do that at all, apparently I "messed up the Luckperms database" when where's the proof?? Exactly: there IS no proof.</p>
  <h1>The follow-up</h1>
  Kat had soon made a post blaming me for everything. Since I believe in fair judgement, I would like to show it here:<br>
  <img src="/static/swiftstuff/katfu.png"><br>
  For my follow up:<br><br>
  She did not pay $96/mo but rather $72/mo, although she <strong>USED</strong> to pay $96/mo.<br>
<br>
  Before I joined, Swift had a bad reputation. And when I contributed for a good host, the players (and profit) skyrocketed. I helped the server get where it is now, and now that Kat has enough money to ditch me, that's what she did.
  <br><br>
  To be brutally honest, I used to have a gambling addiction, but not anymore. I told her about the gambling addiction because it started from spin crates on a different server, and I told her to remove them on Swift. She never listened. <strong>SHE</strong> was the one that dismissed my pleas to remove what ultimately led to my gambling addiction. <strong>My pleas fell on deaf ears.</strong><br><br>Yes, despite my gambling addiction, I am 13, but I've been playing Minecraft for a long time, in fact since I was 2 (it was when I last accessed my world, I don't remember what I did in there so I don't know if it was more of a guided tour or me playing myself). I know y'all don't believe me, but it's true.<br><br>Anyway, I had been addicted to spin crates for a while, and eventually started gambling on BloxFlip, the only platform I knew at the time. Gambling is DESIGNED to keep you hooked. I genuinely enjoyed the games, but as even Stake, a gambling platform ITSELF puts it: <i>"Gambling should always be a form of entertainment."</i> It eventually became far more for me. When BloxFlip shut down, I stopped gambling. And I'd like to keep it that way.<br>
<br>
  She never explained to me that she had to <i>calculate</i> the deal, just that she'd give at the end of the month. One of the reasons I removed her access was she said she would demote me at the end of the month (after she transfers), so I thought "why don't i make it sooner?" but wasn't sure. But I also started crying. I told my mom, she told my dad and my dad forced me to remove her now.<br>
  <i>For clarification: The above text was edited from its original state. The "why don't i make it sooner?" was from the earlier version, and does not reflect exactly what you may interpret it as now.</i><br>
<br>
  And it's not <i>ME</i> who <i>CHOSE</i> not to give the files, it's <strong>MY DAD</strong> who <strong>FORCED</strong> me not to.<br>
  I've told Kat this multiple times but she kept insisting that I was the one who did not let her transfer.<br>
<br>
  Overall the fact that she lied multiple times:<br>
  - I did not need the money for a gambling addiction<br>
  - She ignored the fact it was my DAD who didn't let me transfer<br>
  - She used to claim she made $20 when my approximate calculations prove $331/mo<br>
  - and more<br>
<br>
  How can I trust her to give the 40%?<br>
  And if I'm demoted anyway, why would I wait for an unlikely 40%?<br>
<br>
  Oh yeah and also my servers were actually good in specifications, that's one of the reasons that Swift growed exponentially after the first few months of me being here. In fact, she didn't tell me she switched to Bloom for "bad" hosting, instead she gave the real answer: <strong>crashing</strong>, which was easily preventable by me turning off other servers. That's what I did. That's why she came back.<br>
She came back MANY times, but always found a reaason to leave.<br>Think about it, if the performace was sub-par or mediocre, why did she leave SPvP/CPvP/LS with me?<br>You can't say money. She spends $72/mo and earns $385.<br><br>The reason it couldn't handle a DDoS attack? Because our host did not provide good DDoS protection.<br>
  The same person who DDoSed Swift DDoSed Pika Network's website and showed me. Pika uses <strong>cloudflare</strong> for their website, which is a strong (and widely considered the <i>best</i>) DDoS protection, yet they could still bypass it.<br>If they can bypass that, OBVIOUSLY they can bypass mine.<br><br>Kat called me money hungry. But who was it who ignored my pleas to remove the thing that ultimately led to my gambling addiction?<br>Who was it that decided to give me 0% until January (which she still hasn't paid me for)?<br>Who was it that decided to sell stolen Minecraft accounts? I don't know if she knew it was stolen, but I told her, and she still continued to sell it after a medium-length hiatus.<br><br>If there's <strong>ANYTHING</strong> to be taken away from this, it's that she is not a good person. <strong>SHE</strong> was the one that decided to repeatedly trigger me. The fact that I paid so much for the server, plugins and more yet she still decided to ditch me. <br><br><strong>Thank you for those standing in solidarity with me.</strong> As a 13-year-old chronically sick patient with Tourette's, Ulcerative Colitis, Autism, ADHD and so much more, I am super grateful to those who stood with me through everything.<br><br>Thanks, and until next time,<br>binbinuser.<h1>Follow-up 2</h1>Kat said this:<br><i>For those of you who think I’m only doing this for the money, let me clear things up. I’m spending money on hosting, plugins, monthly plans for the store, and I work tirelessly to manage and maintain all the servers. And just to be clear—Binbin doesn’t help with any of that. All he does is host the server, which, by the way, he initially offered to let me use for free. I even made the decision to quit my partnership with SparkedHost to use his server, but it’s a risk because even a basic DDoS attack could bring it down. This is a cracked server, and we don’t earn much from it. I’m doing all of this because I genuinely love Minecraft server development—it’s a passion of mine. I have my own dropshipping business that I focus on, and I don’t rely on this server to make money.<br>
<br>
  So, I ask those of you spreading rumors on TikTok or other social media platforms, trying to bring us down, to stop. It’s not helping anyone, and it’s not going to take us down. I’m doing this because it makes me happy, and no matter what is said, that won’t change. 🥰🫶</i><br>
  <br>But I will counter that:
  <ul>
    <li>"Binbin does not help with maintaining" --> I tried! I really tried, but she removed all my work when I tried to work</li>
    <li>"I'm spending money on hosting" --> she spent $72/mo and made $385/mo</li>
    <li>"I'm spending money on plugins" --> No she didn't! <strong>I</strong> was the one that spent money on that</li>
    <li>"I'm spending money on monthly plans for the store" --> I don't know about now, but she never had Tebex Plus when I was there, and even if she had it, that's 12.5 GBP (15.74 USD)</li>
  </ul>

  DrW1zzle also decided to post this (note he had since changed it since to something slightly more detailed but still implying the same thing):<br><i>
  # Setting the Record Straight on Swift SMP<br>
<br>
  Hey everyone, I want to make a public statement about the misinformation going around about Katleal and Swift SMP.<br>
<br>
  ## Binbin's Hosting<br>
  Binbin originally offered to host the server for free, but his hosting was untested it couldn't even survive a basic DDoS attack. He also didn't help with the economy server, so Katleal moved it to a new host, which now has a cost of $96 per month.<br>
<br>
  ## The Payment Dispute<br>
  Katleal promised to pay Binbin 40% of sales at the end of the month. But Binbin wanted the money in advance because of his **gambling addiction**. Katleal refused him that, and he deactivated the access to the server and blocked the file transfers, causing a massive interruption. That's why Binbin was taken out of Swift SMP.<br>
<br>
  ## Doxxing Allegations<br>
  Neither Katleal nor any member of the team has ever doxxed anyone. There is no proof to support this.<br>
<br>
  ## Greedy Owner?<br>
  Katleal has put her own money into keeping the server alive, she's paying $96 a month to keep the economy server alive. She's not doing this for a profit but to benefit the server.<br>
<br>
  ## Corrupt Staff<br>
  Swift SMP staff members have done their best and enforced the rules in an unbiased manner. Bans or demotions have occurred because of actual issues, not personal grudges.<br>
<br>
  ## Banning Good Players<br>
  Players get banned for breaking rules, not for being "good players." If anyone feels they were unjustly banned, they can appeal by making a ticket.<br>
<br>
  ## Exposing Private Information<br>
  There's no evidence of anyone leaking private info. It is the one that wants downfall for swift that has leaked private information about us.<br>
<br>
  ## Final Thoughts<br>
  It's obvious that many of these allegations are simply untrue stories intended to harm Swift SMP's reputation. Katleal has tried everything to keep the server operating fairly. If someone has actual issues, come with proof, but end the drama.<br>
<br></i>
  <br><br>
  I'd like to also debunk this:<br><ul>
    <li>I did help with the economy server, but she removed everything I worked on.</li>
    <li>She had a proxy. She never exposed my server to DDoS. It is true mine can't handle a DDoS attack, but she never exposed my actual server address meaning all DDoSes that Swift experienced was <strong>COMPLETELY</strong> on her.</li>
    <li>As I said about FIFTY TIMES, I DID NOT WANT THE MONEY IN ADVANCE BECAUSE OF A <strong>"GAMBLING ADDICTION."</strong> As I have clarified, I stopped gambling after BloxFlip shut down. I said "where's my 40%" which I know will be misinterpreted but I never intended to ask for it in advance. I did NOT ask to get it in advance for a gambling addiction!!</li>
    <li>So you think you didn't Dox anyone, huh? Well then take a look at your shame channel a while back. You'd see HUGE amounts of doxxing! A person was doxxed for nuking, and many other people were doxxed.</li>
    <li>Greedy Owner? YES. I've spent $400 a MONTH on the server. It's not her who put the most money, it's me. And she didn't use HER money, she used the money she earnt from the store.</li>
    <li>Hmm... so you're telling me staff weren't fired for personal grudges... Hm... what about Hausehause22? Joyyyysiiii? Their builder rank was technically staff yet they were banned for being ASC, <strong>NOT</strong> something against the rules</li>
    <li>And they were banned for breaking the rules?? And you say they can appeal, but you always laugh at them in the appeals and deny almost every single one. When they're banned from Discord they can't even file an appeal!</li>
    <li>There IS evidence of you leaking private info IF YOU JUST LOOK AT THE SHAME CHANNEL.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  Overall she is a monster. I had told her MULTIPLE times it's my dad who didn't want files transferred and she kept blaming me for it. I had told her MULTIPLE times it's not for a 'gambling addiction' and she kept claiming it was.
  <br><br>Oh yeah and don't forget, I asked her to explain herself. If she came up with a reasonable explanation, I would've shown it here as evidence <i>AGAINST</i> me. Buuuuuut she blocked me:<img src="/static/swiftstuff/katblock.png"><br>
  <br><h3>To Katleal,</h3>
  <h2>Stop it.</h2>
  Stop trying to evade your crimes and questionable practices. Just stop. Accept responsibility.<br><br>
