    <h1>The initial version (scroll down for the follow-up)</h1>
    I asked AI to summarize it and it said this. Many details are inaccurate because I followed up with them but the AI did not recognize this:
  <br><br>
    You share your frustrating experience with a Minecraft server situation. It started when Kat, another server owner, gave admin permissions to some staff members who ended up deleting everything you had created. This was especially upsetting because you had invested both significant time (weeks of work) and money (over $70) into developing a special gamemode. You also reveal your extensive background with Minecraft servers, having created more than 100 Minehut servers in total, though many of them didn't succeed despite your efforts. The financial aspect was also a point of tension - you had only asked for a small percentage of the earnings (1-10%, with 1% being as little as $3) but were turned down. Throughout the conversation, you strongly defend your commitment to the players, explaining how you always took their feedback seriously and tried to help them, which you feel was very different from Kat's approach of focusing mainly on the store and creating crates. You describe how you used to be in charge of both the eco and proxy gamemodes, but now they're no longer under your control. The whole experience has left you feeling deeply discouraged about creating new servers, despite your passion for it, because you feel you've been taken advantage of too many times. By the end of the chat, you show your knowledge of Thai language, explaining some interesting details about gender-neutral and masculine terms used in Thai, like how "chan" is gender-neutral but usually feminine, while "phom" or "hair" are masculine terms.<br><br>
